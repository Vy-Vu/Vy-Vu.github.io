        <p>Catching Fish is a two-player game. The penguin player have to catch the fish<br>
        before itthe fish player eats all the rainbow to raise their score which <br>
        is 1 point for each rainbow. This game has 3 levels which is easy, medium, and hard.<br>
        If the fish eats all the rainbow before the penguin can catch it, then the fish<br>
        player wins. If the penguin catching before the fish can eats all the rainbow then<br> 
        the penguin player wins.</p>
        
        <p>I decide to create this game because I used to play the similar game and it<br>
        is very interesting for me. The first successful point in the development process of<br>
        my game is fish and peguin are sprite. The another successful is my home screen<br> 
        where I put the 3 buttons of game level. The two obstacles that I have in the<br>
        development of my game are the more bolck and the scoring. If I have more time to<br>
        work on my game, I will change the frame to be more nicely.</p>

         On the left is an algorithm that contributes significantly to the game. Because it shows<br>
        how the character changes by pressing the up and down, left and right. In particular,<br>
        the fish makes the movement by 1 when clicking these four arrows.
